### remove reddit from reddit, leaving only the content

(this is an empty repository to remind myself of this idea)

##### 1. scrape various subreddit(s) for links

##### 2. for each link, use a content-extraction tool (along the lines of embed.ly) to create an associated headline and find a published date (if a date cant be found, default to date submitted to reddit)

##### 3. render links in chronological order, using date and headlines from step #2

The end result: you get the linked content from reddit without any reddit "content" itself. The user-created headline, the comments, the upvotes, and the rankings are all removed.
